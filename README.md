# Animation and Gestures Examples

## Project Description
Showcase some animations and gestures inspired in different online courses. Most of them made with the porpouse of understanding [React-Native-Gesture-Hadler](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler) and [React-Native-Reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated).


## Project setup
### General
Clone the repo and install dependencies by doing ```yarn``` , then follow through if there are errors.

### iOS 
You will likely need to go into the ios folder, and run ```pod install``` before 
running a ios device or simulator.

When that's ready, ```yarn ios``` should sort you out.

### Android

```yarn android``` - You'll need a running ADK And SDK already for this to work - you can check if you have one by typing ```adb devices``` and see that you have a device ready.
